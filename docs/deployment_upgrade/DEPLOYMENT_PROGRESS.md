## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Backend Health Endpoint (COMPLETE)

### Implementation Status
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Date Completed**: 2025-10-26

### What Was Done
1. ‚úÖ Created `backend/app/services/health_service.py`
   - Service layer for health check logic
   - Database connectivity testing with `SELECT 1`
   - Returns comprehensive health status

2. ‚úÖ Created `backend/app/routers/health.py`
   - New `/api/health` endpoint
   - Uses health service for business logic
   - Returns 200 when healthy, 503 when unhealthy

3. ‚úÖ Updated `backend/app/main.py`
   - Registered health router
   - Maintains backward compatibility with `/health` endpoint

### Verification
```bash
# Old endpoint (backward compatible)
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","service":"ParchMark API","version":"1.0.0"}

# New endpoint with database check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","service":"ParchMark API","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### Files Modified
- `backend/app/main.py` - Added health router import and registration
- Created: `backend/app/services/health_service.py`
- Created: `backend/app/services/__init__.py`
- Created: `backend/app/routers/health.py`

- **Date Completed**: 2025-10-26

### What Was Done
1. ‚úÖ Updated `docker-compose.prod.yml`

   - Frontend: Changed from build to GHCR image (`ghcr.io/tejgandham/parchmark-frontend:latest`)
   - Added backend health check using `/api/health` endpoint
   - Added frontend health check using wget spider test
   - Updated frontend dependency to wait for backend health condition

2. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Removed hardcoded database credentials
