## Implementation Details

ParchMark uses Zustand for state management and React Router for navigation. The application follows a feature-based architecture with clean separation of concerns. Authentication is implemented with protected routes to secure user content. Styling is handled by Chakra UI with custom theme configuration.

The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and consistent environment across different platforms.
