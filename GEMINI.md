# ParchMark Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ParchMark application, a web-based markdown note-taking application.

## Architecture

ParchMark is a classic client-server web application with a separate frontend and backend.

*   **Frontend:** A modern React application built with Vite and TypeScript.
    *   **UI:** Chakra UI component library.
    *   **State Management:** Zustand.
    *   **Routing:** React Router.
    *   **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library.
*   **Backend:** A Python API built with the FastAPI framework.
    *   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    *   **Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM with an SQLite database for development.
    *   **API Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) and ReDoc documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI.

## Building and Running

The project is fully containerized with Docker and uses Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.

### Development

To run the application in a development environment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:

*   `parchmark-frontend`: The React development server, accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
*   `parchmark-backend`: The FastAPI backend server, accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Production

To run the application in a production environment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

This uses the production-optimized Docker configurations. See the `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` file for detailed instructions on setting up DNS, SSL, and Nginx Proxy Manager.

### Key Scripts

*   **UI Tests:** `npm test` (run from the `ui` directory)
*   **Backend Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (run from the `backend` directory)

## Development Conventions

*   **Backend:** The backend follows a standard FastAPI project structure, with code organized into `auth`, `database`, `models`, `routers`, and `schemas` directories.
*   **Frontend:** The frontend uses a feature-based architecture.
*   **API:** The API is documented and tested using the interactive Swagger UI at `/docs` on the backend service.
*   **Database:** The database is automatically initialized and seeded with test data in the development environment. For production, manual user management scripts are provided in `backend/scripts/manage_users.py`.

## Future Plans

There is a detailed plan to migrate the backend from Python/FastAPI to Elixir/Phoenix to improve scalability and enable real-time features. See `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for more details.
