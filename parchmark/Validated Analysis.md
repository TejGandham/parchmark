## Executive Summary

  

AXO373 is a mature, enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository managing two product lines: **OpenAsset** (digital asset management) and **ShredAI** (AI-powered document processing). The repository demonstrates industry best practices with a three-layer architecture, comprehensive automation, and robust security controls.

  

## Repository Architecture

  

### Three-Layer Pattern (Validated)

  

The repository implements a clean separation of concerns across three layers:

  

```

AXO373/

├── submodules/ # Business Layer - Reusable infrastructure patterns

├── modules/ # Use Case Layer - Service-specific implementations

└── env/ # Presentation Layer - Environment deployments

```

  

**Benefits of this architecture:**

- **DRY Principle**: Reusable components prevent code duplication

- **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between dev/staging/prod

- **Change Management**: Isolated changes reduce blast radius

- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services or environments

  

### Layer Details

  

#### 1. Business Layer (`/submodules/`)

Standardized, reusable infrastructure patterns:

- `ecs_fargate_service` - Container orchestration pattern

- `alb_with_waf` - Load balancer with security

- `rds_postgres`, `rds_mysql` - Database patterns

- `lambda_api_service` - Serverless API pattern

- `eventbridge_*` - Event-driven patterns

- `s3_bucket_*` - Storage patterns

  

#### 2. Use Case Layer (`/modules/`)

Service implementations prefixed with "AXO" numbers:

- Environment and region agnostic

- Compose multiple submodules

- Service-specific business logic

- Examples: AXO484 (integration API), AXO473 (document management)

  

#### 3. Presentation Layer (`/env/`)

Actual deployments organized by:

- **Product Line**: `oa/` (OpenAsset), `shredai/` (ShredAI)

- **Cloud Provider**: `aws/` (primary), potential for multi-cloud

- **Service/State**: Individual deployment units

- **Environment**: `.tfvars` files (development, staging, production)

  

## Product Lines Analysis

  

### OpenAsset (OA)

A comprehensive digital asset management platform:

- **Core Services**: Main application, API services

- **Supporting Services**: Backup, multimedia processing, search

- **AI/ML Services**: Facial recognition, visual search, GenAI

- **Integration Services**: Procore, data import/export

- **Multi-Region**: US (us-east-1), EU (eu-west-2), APAC (ap-southeast-2)

  

### ShredAI

Modern, microservices-based document processing platform:

- **Frontend**: User interface (React-based)

- **File Management**: Core document handling (includes AXO473)

- **AI Services**: Document analysis and processing

- **Multimedia**: Media file processing

- **OA Integration**: Bridge to OpenAsset (AXO484)

  

## Infrastructure Patterns

  

### Compute Patterns

1. **ECS Fargate** (Primary)

- Serverless containers

- Auto-scaling

- ARM64 architecture for cost optimization

- Health checks and monitoring

  

2. **Lambda** (Event-driven)

- Async processing

- Edge computing (Lambda@Edge)

- Scheduled tasks

  

### Network Architecture

  

#### VPC Design

- Standard CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 per account

- Multi-AZ deployment (3 AZs)

- Subnet layers:

- Public: NAT gateways, bastion hosts

- Application: ECS tasks, Lambda

- Persistence: RDS, ElastiCache

- VPC endpoints for AWS services

  

#### Load Balancer Strategy

- **Public ALB**: Internet-facing services with WAF

- **Private ALB**: Internal service communication

- SSL/TLS termination at ALB

- Path and host-based routing

  

### Security Architecture

  

#### Network Security

- Security groups with least-privilege

- NACLs for subnet-level control

- WAF rules on public endpoints

- VPN access for management

  

#### Data Security

- KMS encryption at rest

- TLS in transit

- Secrets Manager for credentials

- IAM roles for service accounts

  

## AXO484 Deployment Strategy

  

### Dual Deployment Architecture

AXO484 is designed to have **TWO separate deployments** serving different purposes:

  

#### 1. Public ALB Deployment (Existing)

- **Location**: `/env/shredai/aws/oa_integration/`

- **ALB**: Public ALB for external access

- **Domain**: `axo484.{environment}.shred-app.ai`

- **Purpose**: External integration endpoint

- **Status**: Deployed in dev/staging only (not production)

  

#### 2. Private ALB Deployment (New)

- **Location**: `/env/shredai/aws/oa_integration_private/` (to be created)

- **ALB**: Private ALB for internal access

- **Domain**: `oa-integration-api.{environment}.shred-app.ai`

- **Purpose**: Internal service-to-service integration

- **Status**: Documented, ready for implementation

  

### Architectural Rationale

This dual deployment pattern allows:

- **External Integration**: Public ALB instance for external systems

- **Internal Integration**: Private ALB instance for secure internal communication

- **Security Isolation**: Different security profiles for different use cases

- **Flexible Access Patterns**: Support both external partners and internal services

  

## CI/CD and Automation

  

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **Plan Workflows**: Validate changes on PR

- **Apply Workflows**: Deploy after merge

- **Drift Detection**: Regular compliance checks

- **Self-Hosted Runners**: Better performance and control

  

### Deployment Automation

```yaml

# deploy-config-shred.yaml structure

STATE_DIRS_DEPLOY: # Deployment order

STATE_DIRS_DESTROY: # Destruction order (reverse)

DEPENDENCIES: # Inter-service dependencies

KNOWN_STATES_REQUIRING_VPN: # VPN-required deployments

```

  

### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy_env.sh`: Sequential deployment with prompts

- `quick_deploy.py`: Parallel deployment for speed

- `setup.sh`: Initial environment setup

  

## Best Practices Observed

  

### Strengths

1. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns

2. **Reusability**: DRY principle throughout

3. **Scalability**: Easy to extend

4. **Security First**: Encryption, IAM, network isolation

5. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ, auto-scaling

6. **Cost Optimization**: ARM64, right-sizing

7. **Comprehensive Automation**: Full CI/CD pipeline

8. **Flexible Architecture**: Supports multiple deployment patterns

  

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Policy as Code**: Implement OPA/Sentinel for compliance

2. **Service Mesh**: Consider for complex service communication

3. **Documentation Sync**: Ensure docs match implementation

4. **Automated Testing**: Infrastructure testing with Terratest

  

## Operational Insights

  

### Deployment Order

1. `setup` - Account initialization

2. `network` - VPC and networking

3. `databases` - RDS clusters

4. `setup_common` - Shared resources

5. Service-specific deployments

  

### Environment Management

- **Production**: Full HA, strict controls

- **Staging**: Production-like testing

- **Development**: Individual developer accounts (dev01, dev02, etc.)

  

### Monitoring Stack

- **CloudWatch**: Native AWS monitoring

- **Datadog**: Enhanced observability

- **PagerDuty**: Incident management

- **LaunchDarkly**: Feature flags

  

## Key Implementation Patterns

  

### Service Module Flexibility

The AXO484 module demonstrates excellent flexibility:

```hcl

# Can be configured for either public or private ALB

alb_config = {

listener_arn = data.aws_lb_listener.[public|private]_443.arn

security_group_id = data.aws_security_group.alb_[public|private].id

# ... other ALB configurations

}

```

  

This pattern allows the same module to be deployed in different contexts with different configurations.

  

### Multi-Instance Service Pattern

The repository supports deploying multiple instances of the same service:

- Different configurations (public vs private)

- Different databases for data isolation

- Different domains for clear identification

- Same codebase for consistency

  

## Recommendations

  

### Immediate Actions

1. **Implement Private ALB Deployment**: Create the new AXO484 private instance

2. **Document Dual Deployment Pattern**: Clearly document why two instances exist

3. **Security Review**: Ensure proper access controls for each instance

  

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Service Mesh Evaluation**: For advanced traffic management

2. **API Gateway**: Consider for public API management

3. **Cost Optimization**: Review dual deployment costs

  

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Multi-Cloud Readiness**: Abstract provider dependencies

2. **GitOps Migration**: Consider ArgoCD/Flux

3. **Platform Engineering**: Build internal developer platform
